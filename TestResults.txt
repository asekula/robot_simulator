Test results for exploration as of commit f04d06397f3e8f1ee0467404d02528d52457069e:
	94 out of 100 (for a 16 by 16 maze)

**************

Todo:
	1. Fix that one Solver bug (when the path changes due to localization error).
		(can do this by not removing the cell from the path until it reaches 2nd cell in path,
		thus not relying on currentCell to get the goalLocation). 
	2. Perfect localization.
	3. Test on real robot (including converting to C++).
	4. Optimize code if needed (a few places that we can do this).
