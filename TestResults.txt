Test results for exploration as of commit f04d06397f3e8f1ee0467404d02528d52457069e:
	94 out of 100 (for a 16 by 16 maze)

**************

Todo:
	1. Perfect localization.
	2. Test on real robot (including converting to C++).
	3. Optimize code if needed (a few places that we can do this).
	(4. Speed the robot up on long stretches. Also preprocessing for Dijkstra's in the Solver.)
